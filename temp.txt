So honestly I found it both very rude and upsetting. I didnt really want to go to london and only went as you encuraged me sasying it would be nice to meet up and do things. I even said it would be multiple days as it would be a long trip. I was understanding and did not complain when you said you were going to have alone time despite the whole reason for my trip being to see you. But you were very aggressive both after leaving the paistry shop about us even walking in the same direction, and when you kept encuriging me to not walk with you to your bud. On top of this while we where having burgurs for dinner, you would speak over me every time i started to talk about somthing other than ask you questions, moreover you rarely aksed me anything which is very disapointing as it really shows how little care you had for my opinions or thoughts. 

Again the only reason i was in london was you saying you would like to meet me, so I hooe you get why this is really disrespectfull and hurtful. I would like to point out that after the class this morning when i was leaving, the last time we would see each other i remind you, you were very uninterested and dismissive. The other girl in the room who I had spoken to for only a few sentences sounded both happier, and gave a better goodbye.

You may have been overwhelemed, or feeling lonley. But I hope you see that you were also being very selfish in how you were behaving.
